# MVC Tech Blog

## Description:
This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. I built this site completely from scratch and deployed it to Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation
_________________
You’ll need to use the express-handlebars package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Contr Controllers. You’ll also need the dotenv package to use environment variables, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages to add authentication.
